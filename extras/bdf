#!/usr/bin/perl5

#
#  Goes through text & binaries files, looking for executables
# and files of potential interest; a basic dependency file finder.
#
# Usage:
#
#   $0 -[bcdrvw]
#
#  -b == do full processing even on binary files (false positive alert!)
#  -c == turn off most caching (if having problems fitting in memory)
#  -d == debug (really, you shouldn't use this!)
#  -l == preload common executables into cache (from /bin, /usr/bin, etc.)
#  -p == print out all the parent files of a file
#  -r == do *NOT* do recursion
#  -v == verbose
#  -w == check files found for world-writability as well
#
#  Two basic modes of operation depending on the file type, binary or text:
#
# Binary (determined by perl's -B operator):
#
#	Do a strings on the file; with the -b option it parses each 
# 	line, every token (things seperated by space or various 
#	punctuation marks) will be examined to see if it is a file; 
#	if it isn't a full pathname, it examines the PATH to see if it is in
#	there (see below).  Without the -b flag this tokenizing isn't
#	done and it looks at only full pathnames, so that "echo" would 
#	not be looked at, but "/bin/echo" would be.
#
# Text:
#
#	Parse every line, ignoring shell-style comment lines (beginning
#	with a hash mark (#), and otherwise process as binary file with
#	the -b flag.
#
#  In addition, it looks at the path and does recursion:
#
# The PATH:
#
# 	If PATH is set (via PATH=...), it runs off to get all binaries in
#	the path so that if we see "awk" instead of "/bin/awk" it'll do
#	the right thing.  The -l option loads in some common dirs containing
#	commands, like /bin, /usr/bin, etc.  (Esp. useful for examining 
#	binary files.)
#
# Recursion:
#
#	Normally it looks in the files it is pointed at ****as well as 
#	recursively going through the files that are inside that****.
#	This means if you have a line like:
#
#		echo /usr/local/bin/foo
#
#	The program will also examine the contents of both echo (probably
#	/bin/echo) as well as /usr/local/bin/foo.  This can be turned off
#	with the -r flag.
